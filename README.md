# Exploring African Monsoon Climates with Open Copernicus Data

This is a Python Jupyter Notebook in presenting insights into African Monsoon climates using Earth Observation and Climate Modeling data provided by the WEkEO service and the Copernicus Climate Data Store. 

Particularly West African monsoon characteristics and long-term trends are analyzed, visualized and discussed. Finally, the correlation of monsoon rainfall and fire risk in the Sahel is assessed.

The notebook was prepared by Jan Landwehrs as a contribution to the WEkEO Jupyter Notebook Competition 2022.
